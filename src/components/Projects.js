          <p>Most hair stylists still use a paper and pen appointment book
          so I decided to make a scheduling app.
          The main idea behind the app is to have access to your appointments from anywhere.
          Built using React, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.

          <p>In this app, you play the part of a prestigious art dealer. After creating your user account, 
            you can create an art gallery (or several galleries) 
            and then create or select paintings to display in your new space.

          <p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Moving alongâ€¦ Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Tell them I hate them.
